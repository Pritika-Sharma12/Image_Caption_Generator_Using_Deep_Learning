Image Caption Generator Using Deep Learning on Flickr8K Dataset
The Image Caption Generator is a deep learning project that aims to generate descriptive captions for images using the Flickr8K dataset. This project leveragesConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units forgenerating sequences of words. The Flickr8K dataset, which consists of 8,000 images each paired with five different captions, is used to train the model. Theprocess involves preprocessing images and captions, creating embeddings, and training the model to map image features to natural language descriptions. Thisresults in a model capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant captions for new images.
